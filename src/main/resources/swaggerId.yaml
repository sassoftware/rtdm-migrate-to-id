            steps, rule set steps, or custom object steps. For models and rule
            sets, the URI should include only the object's ID (no revision). For
            custom objects, any decisions with a custom object step referencing an
            object whose URI starts with the provided value is returned.

            Examples:

      description: |
        Returns the list of external artifacts used by a decision revision. Objects used by a step of the steps collection in a decision flow are considered external artifacts. Some examples of such objects are files and web services. This endpoint returns the collection of external artifacts. The collection might be empty if there is no external artifact used by any step of the decision.
        The expected number of external artifacts is small. Therefore, this endpoint does not support any paging, filtering, or sorting of parameters.
